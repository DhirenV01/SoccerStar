I recently explored data analytics in soccer inspired by McKay Johns' fantastic YouTube videos. Using Python, I created a visualization to analyze Kylian Mbappé's shot quantity and quality this season in LaLiga for Real Madrid C.F.

Mbappé hasn’t met the high expectations set for him since joining the reigning LaLiga champions, and the data reflects this performance. He has scored only 3 goals in LaLiga, underperforming his expected goals (xG) of 4.53 by -1.53, with two of those goals coming from penalties. While Mbappé is known for taking a high volume of shots, his shot quality this season has been notably low, with an average of 0.16 xG per shot.

You can find the Python code used to create this visualization and the data scraping method from understat.com on my GitHub. This was a fun project that allowed me to blend my passion for technology and soccer analytics. I look forward to sharing more projects as the European soccer season progresses.
